# TLTP
The Life Transition Project

1 AUG 2025 - It was the first day of the project. It was also the first day to start being sober. I took the intro courses of the Naver Boostcamp pre-course.
  Naver pre-course: Basic computer class for newbies
  
2 AUG 2025 - I could wake up at 6am! It's been a while since I woke up early in the morning as I have suffered so much from the jet lag since I left the UK. I read ~50 pages of co-intelligence, checked tons of youtube videos comparing different bootcamps, and continued to take the Naver Boostcamp pre-course.
  Naver pre-course: Python overview - compiler vs interpreter, why Python?
  
3 AUG 2025 - Woke up at 6:30, continued to read co-inteligence, watched tons of bootcamp-related youtube videos, and continued to take the Naver Boostcamp pre-course. I feel that I am getting to know which bootcamp would suit be the best more and more.
  Naver pre-course: Python coding environment - OS, anaconda, VScode, Jupyter notebook, Google Colab
  
4 AUG 2025 - Woke up at 6:00, had a look at the shortlisted bootcamps, and continued to take the Naver Boostcamp pre-course. The precourses will take around 30 hours to finish, and I will finish them until the 11th so I can apply to the Boostcamp on the 12th. It feels quite good to build some daily routines again.
  Naver pre-course: Variables & List - variable, memory, basic operations, primitive data types, int, float, string, boolean, dynamic typing, operator/operand, list/array, indexing, slicing
                    Functions and Console I/O - function, parameter vs argument, GUI, CLI, print formatting, f-string

5 AUG 2025 - Woke up at 5:10, took quite some time taking the Naver Boostcamp pre-courses. It was the most productive day out of the five days!
  Naver pre-course: Conditionals & Loops - if-else, and, or, not, ternary operators, for loop, while loop, debugging
                    String & Advanced functions - string, indexing, slicing, call by object reference, swap, scoping rule, recursive function, function type hints, docstring, python coding convention
                    Data structure - string, stack, last in first out (LIFO), first in first out (FIFO), push, pop, queue, tuple, set, dict, collections, deque, OrderedDict, defaultdict, counter, namedtuple

6 AUG 2025 - Woke up at 6:20, continued to take Naver Boostcamp pre-courses, and also spent quite some time talking to both ChatGPT and Gemini discussing TLTP.
  Naver pre-course: Pythonic code - split & join, list comprehension, enumerate & zip, lambda & map & reduce, generator, asterisk (*args, **kwargs)
