# TLTP
The Life Transition Project

1 AUG 2025 - It was the first day of the project. It was also the first day to start being sober. I took the intro courses of the Naver Boostcamp pre-course.

2 AUG 2025 - I could wake up at 6am! It's been a while since I woke up early in the morning as I have suffered so much from the jet lag since I left the UK. I read ~50 pages of co-intelligence, checked tons of youtube videos comparing different bootcamps, and continued to take the Naver Boostcamp pre-course.

3 AUG 2025 - Woke up at 6:30, continued to read co-inteligence, watched tons of bootcamp-related youtube videos, and continued to take the Naver Boostcamp pre-course. I feel that I am getting to know which bootcamp would suit be the best more and more.

4 AUG 2025 - Woke up at 6:00, had a look at the shortlisted bootcamps, and continued to take the Naver Boostcamp pre-course. The precourses will take around 30 hours to finish, and I will finish them until the 11th so I can apply to the Boostcamp on the 12th. It feels quite good to build some daily routines again.

5 AUG 2025 - Woke up at 5:10, took quite some time taking the Naver Boostcamp pre-courses. It was the most productive day out of the five days!

6 AUG 2025 - Woke up at 6:20, continued to take Naver Boostcamp pre-courses, and also spent quite some time talking to both ChatGPT and Gemini discussing TLTP.
