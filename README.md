# TLTP
The Life Transition Project

1 AUG 2025 - It was the first day of the project. It was also the first day to start being sober. I took the intro courses of the Naver Boostcamp pre-course.

2 AUG 2025 - I could wake up at 6am! It's been a while since I woke up early in the morning as I have suffered so much from the jet lag since I left the UK. I read ~50 pages of co-intelligence, checked tons of youtube videos comparing different bootcamps, and continued to take the Naver Boostcamp pre-course.
